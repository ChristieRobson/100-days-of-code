# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Tues 3rd January 2016

**Today's Progress**: Started FreeCodeCamp Wikipedia View challenge. Layout done and random button working.

**Thoughts:** Trying to use material design - not sure if it was worth using bootstrap as I've had to override a lot of its values.

### Day 2: Wed 4th January 2016

**Today's Progress**: Continued FreeCodeCamp Wikipedia View challenge. Investigated API and got search results working.

**Thoughts:** Not sure if using API correctly or not - using search and then getting URL by just using given title. Still need to do clean up option for exiting out of then current search and style panels better. Also look at how I'm getting search input contents, I've having to seperately handle an enter press and a button press which I think should be simplier.

### Day 3: Thurs 5th January 2016

**Today's Progress**: Continued FreeCodeCamp Wikipedia View challenge. Functionality and some error handling added.

**Thoughts:** Think I've improved on UX of original by providing feedback when search term is blank or search returns zero results. I think it now meets the requirements of the challenge, however page results are long, think I might want to dearrange how results are shown in the panels.

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

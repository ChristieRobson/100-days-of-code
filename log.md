# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Tues 3rd January 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started FreeCodeCamp Wikipedia View challenge. Layout done and random button working.

**Thoughts:** Trying to use material design - not sure if it was worth using bootstrap as I've had to override a lot of its values.

### Day 2: Wed 4th January 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued FreeCodeCamp Wikipedia View challenge. Investigated API and got search results working.

**Thoughts:** Not sure if using API correctly or not - using search and then getting URL by just using given title. Still need to do clean up option for exiting out of then current search and style panels better. Also look at how I'm getting search input contents, I've having to seperately handle an enter press and a button press which I think should be simplier.

### Day 3: Thurs 5th January 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued FreeCodeCamp Wikipedia View challenge. Functionality and some error handling added.

**Thoughts:** Think I've improved on UX of original by providing feedback when search term is blank or search returns zero results. I think it now meets the requirements of the challenge, however page results are long, think I might want to dearrange how results are shown in the panels.

### Day 4: Fri 6th January 2017

**Today's Progress**: Picked up FreeCodeCamp TwitchTv challenge again. Returns logo and stream info.

**Thoughts:** I started this a while ago but got confused when it stopped working - there is now an update on how to get round this on FCC. I got it working again and havemoved from having the users listed in the html to being created programatically. This means FreeCodeCamp is currently lower case and I need to get the proper display name from the returned json instread(TODO). I haven't styled it at all yet so it looks very basic.

### Day 5: Sat 7th January 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added returning of the users icon and display name. Started styling.

**Thoughts:** Learnt that you can't do border radius on a tr only the td'd within it, so to create a table row that looks like it has rounded edges need to style first and last td child of the tr.

### Day 6: Sunday 8th January 2017

**Today's Progress**: Minor styling. Added buttons to toggle between all/online only/offline only.

**Thoughts:** Getting radio buttons in to choose between online/offline was easy to do with Jquery, just needed to have some classes on to identify which was which, but I'd added these today so I could differentiate byt coloured background. This didn't look to be a requirement of the project but they had done it in the example. The styling is OK but I think I could do better, but for now I'd prefer to move on to a more interesting project (the difficult bit/learn for this task was getting the return from the API which is in).

### Day 7: Monday 9th January 2017

**Today's Progress**: Picked up FreeCodeCamp Pomorodo clock again.

**Thoughts:** Started again getting an arc border to fill on a timer. Have just got circle arc stopping and starting, need to fit this into the rest of the clock section next.

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
